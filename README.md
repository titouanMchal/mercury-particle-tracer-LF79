# mercury-particle-tracer-LF79
Test particle tracing code at Mercury 
- Adapted from D. Delcourt Fortran code.
- Uses Luhman-Friesen magnetic field model (1979, adapted to Mercury) and a Volland-Stern distribution for the electrostatic potential (1978).
- This model is very simplified and will be replaced in future versions.

Required python packages : numpy, scipy, matplotlib
