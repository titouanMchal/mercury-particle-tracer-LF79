Test particle tracing code at Mercury 
- Test particle tracing code adapted from D. Delcourt Fortran code.
- Uses Luhman-Friesen magnetic field model (1979, adapted to Mercury) and a Volland-Stern distribution for the electrostatic potential
- This model is very simplified and will be replaced in future versions.
